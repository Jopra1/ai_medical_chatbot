# ai_medical_chatbot
The aim was to create a medical assistant chatbot that takes in symptoms from the user as inputs, asks relevant follow up questions to narrow down possibilities and finally reach a diagnosis , the chatbot provides the diagnosis and the speciality , then it fetches the information of doctors realted to that speciality from a custom created database, along with the hospital information. The important aspect of this chatbot is the interactiveness, most locally run models that are finetuned on medical data, rarely interact, most of these chatbots work by giving a diagnosis directly after the user inputs symptoms, they do not provide further enquiries to completely understand the context to provide an appropriate response, our chatbot attempts to eliminate that problem
